## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Your settings are automatically saved in `~/.config/clickclack/config.toml`. Here's an example of what it looks like:

```

## Usage

Just run:
```bash
clickclack
```

## ‚ú® What's This Magic?

- üéµ Real-time mechanical keyboard sounds that'll make your fingers dance
- üéöÔ∏è Sound tweaks that would make an audio engineer jealous:
  - Volume control (from "library whisper" to "wake the neighbors")
  - Frequency adjustment (from "gentle butterfly" to "angry typewriter")
  - Decay rate (from "quick tap" to "dramatic echo")
- ü™∂ Lightweight menu bar app that sits quietly in the corner (until you start typing!)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning-fast response time (because nobody likes delayed gratification)
- üîí Privacy-focused (we don't care what you're typing, we just make it sound awesome)


## üîí Privacy (Serious Business)

ClickClack is like a good friend - it listens only when you want it to and keeps no secrets. It:
- Doesn't log your keystrokes (we're not that kind of app)
- Doesn't care which keys you're pressing (type 'pizza' 100 times, we won't judge)
- Doesn't send any data anywhere (what happens on your keyboard, stays on your keyboard)
